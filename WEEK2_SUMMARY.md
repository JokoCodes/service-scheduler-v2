# Week 2 Completion Summary

## âœ… Tasks Completed

### 1. Web API Service (@service-scheduler/web-api)
- âœ… **Technology**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- âœ… **Features**:
  - Admin authentication (Supabase + JWT)
  - CRUD operations on bookings with rich queries
  - Dashboard analytics endpoint
- âœ… **Environment**:
  - .env.example for configuration
  - CORS setup for development

### 2. Mobile API Service (@service-scheduler/mobile-api)
- âœ… **Technology**: Fastify with TypeScript
- âœ… **Features**:
  - Employee authentication (Supabase + JWT)
  - Job status updates with location/photos
  - Real-time WebSocket support
  - Location tracking  
- âœ… **Environment**:
  - .env.example for configuration

### 3. Authentication Middleware
- Dual authentication strategy (Supabase + JWT)
- Role-based access control
- Middleware reuse across routes

### 4. Shared Database Connector
- Centralized Supabase client configuration
- Load-balanced connections for mobile
- Optimized queries for both services

### 5. File Organization
- Consistent structure under `services/`
- Organized routes by feature
- Separate middleware, utility, and route files

### 6. Documentation & Configuration
- Comprehensive README.md for API services
- Example environment files for both services
- Clear quick start and deployment instructions

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Frontend Development
- **Web Dashboard**: Develop admin features utilizing new Web API
- **Mobile App**: Implement job tracking, notifications, and real-time updates

### Quality Assurance
- Implement end-to-end testing for both services
- Unit tests for core logic and database interactions

### Production Deployment
- Set up CI/CD for automated deployments
- Monitoring and logging strategies for both APIs

## ðŸ’¡ Achieved Benefits

- **Modular Architecture**: Independent services allow focused scaling
- **Continuous Integration**: Consistent package management across the project
- **Type Safety from End-to-End**: Shared types prevent API client mismatch
- **Optimized for Performance**: Both APIs are tailored to their respective client needs

Both backend services are ready for end-to-end testing and frontend consumption, allowing the next phase of frontend development to proceed with robust, well-defined endpoints.
