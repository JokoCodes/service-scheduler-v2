# Enterprise Job Pick-Up Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the **enterprise-grade** code changes made to implement the job pick-up functionality where staff members can accept assignments and the system automatically updates the relevant database tables. The implementation uses proper profile-to-employee resolution and enterprise-level data flow patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enterprise Mobile API Enhancement
**File:** `/services/mobile-api/src/routes/jobs.ts`

**Key Enterprise Features:**
- **Auto-Provisioning:** Automatically creates employee records from profiles
- **Profile-to-Employee Resolution:** Proper data flow from `profileId` → `employeeId`
- **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Company-scoped employee creation
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Enterprise-grade error codes and messages
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging for enterprise compliance

**New Enterprise Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/jobs/bookings/:bookingId/staff` - Staff assignment with auto-provisioning
- `PUT /api/jobs/bookings/:bookingId/staff/:assignmentId` - Assignment status updates
- `POST /api/jobs/pickup` - Dedicated job pickup endpoint

**Database Updates:**
- Uses proper `employees.id` references (not `profiles.id`)
- Database triggers automatically update `staff_fulfilled` count
- Enterprise audit trail with timestamps and status tracking

### 2. Enhanced Mobile Jobs Service
**File:** `/apps/mobile/src/lib/services/jobsService.ts`

**Key Changes:**
- Updated `assignJobToEmployee()` to use new staff assignment API endpoints
- Added `acceptJobAssignment()` method for updating assignment status
- Added `pickupJob()` method for dedicated job pick-up functionality
- Updated API endpoints to use the proper staff management structure

### 3. New Mobile Job Pickup API Endpoint
**File:** `/services/web-api/src/app/api/mobile/staff/jobs/pickup/route.ts`

**Features:**
- Dedicated endpoint for mobile staff to pick up jobs
- Validates assignment ownership and status
- Updates both `booking_staff_assignments` and `bookings` tables
- Creates notifications for admin users
- Returns comprehensive job and assignment details

### 4. Database Schema Utilization
**Existing Schema:** Already implemented via migration `002_staff_management.sql`

**Key Features Used:**
- `booking_staff_assignments` table for tracking individual assignments
- Automatic triggers that update `staff_fulfilled` count when assignments change
- `booking_staff_summary` view for efficient mobile app queries
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

### 5. Test Script
**File:** `/test-staff-assignment.sql`

**Purpose:**
- Comprehensive testing of database triggers and views
- Validates that staff_fulfilled counts update correctly
- Tests the complete job pickup workflow
- Includes cleanup procedures

## Database Updates When Job is Picked Up

### booking_staff_assignments Table Updates:
- `status`: Changes from 'assigned' to 'accepted'
- `accepted_at`: Set to current timestamp
- `notes`: Optional notes from the staff member
- `updated_at`: Set to current timestamp

### bookings Table Updates (via Database Triggers):
- `staff_fulfilled`: Automatically incremented when assignment status becomes 'accepted'
- The triggers count all assignments with status in ('assigned', 'accepted', 'completed')

## API Endpoints Available

### For Mobile Staff:
1. `POST /api/mobile/staff/jobs/pickup` - Pick up a specific job assignment
2. `PUT /api/bookings/[id]/staff/[assignmentId]` - Update assignment status
3. `GET /api/mobile/staff/assignments` - Get all assignments for staff member

### For Admin:
1. `POST /api/bookings/[id]/staff` - Assign staff to booking
2. `GET /api/bookings/[id]/staff` - Get all staff for booking
3. `DELETE /api/bookings/[id]/staff/[assignmentId]` - Remove specific assignment

## Workflow

1. **Admin assigns staff** → Creates record in `booking_staff_assignments` with status 'assigned'
2. **Staff sees assignment** → Via mobile app assignments list
3. **Staff picks up job** → Calls pickup API or updates assignment status to 'accepted'
4. **Database updates** → Triggers automatically update `staff_fulfilled` count
5. **Notifications sent** → Admin receives notification about job pickup
6. **Status tracking** → Job shows as partially/fully staffed based on requirements

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Run the database test script:**
   ```sql
   psql -d your_database -f test-staff-assignment.sql
   ```

2. **Test the mobile API endpoints** using the mobile app or API testing tools

3. **Verify database consistency** by checking that staff counts update correctly

## Security Considerations

- Only assigned employees can update their own assignment status
- Admin users can update any assignment
- RLS policies ensure data isolation
- Authentication required for all API endpoints
- Input validation prevents invalid status transitions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time notifications** - WebSocket integration for instant updates
2. **Assignment conflicts** - Handle cases where multiple staff try to pick up the same job
3. **Capacity management** - Prevent over-staffing beyond requirements
4. **Skills matching** - Consider employee skills when showing available jobs
5. **Geographic optimization** - Show jobs based on employee location

## Notes

- The database triggers handle the staff count updates automatically, ensuring consistency
- The system supports partial staffing (some staff assigned, not all requirements fulfilled)
- The mobile app can show staffing status to help staff understand team requirements
- All changes are logged with timestamps for audit purposes
